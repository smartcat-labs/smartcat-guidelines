# Smartcat coding guidelines

## General rules
Inside this folder you can find formatter we use and checkstyle which should be enabled for all projects we do. Checkstyle automates lot of things we use, here we will outline guidelines which need further explaining.

## Test naming
Try to explain thing you test as good as you can in test name. Do not start with 'test' since it does not hold any value. Start with 'should' since it makes you really think what are you testing and you will end up with clear sentence explaining test case. Use underscores instead of camel case in test names.
